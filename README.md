# WorkoutPlannerApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.8.

## Project Overview
The Workout Planner app is an Angular-based application that allows users to plan their weekly workout routines. Users can:

- Organize workouts by days of the week.
- Add workout groups for each day (Legs, Push, Pull, Full Body, etc.).
- Search for exercises from a workout API (ExerciseDB).
- Customize each exercise with the number of sets, repetitions, and optional weights.
- Save the workout plan for future use and track workout completion.

## Features

- **Weekly Workout Planner**: Organize your workouts by day, from Monday to Sunday.
- **Workout Groups**: Create workout groups for each day (e.g., Legs, Push, Pull, Full Body).
- **Exercise Search**: Search for exercises from an external workout API and add them to your workout plan.
- **Customize Workouts**: Add sets, reps, and weights for each exercise.
- **Save and Track**: Save your workout plan and track your progress throughout the week.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
